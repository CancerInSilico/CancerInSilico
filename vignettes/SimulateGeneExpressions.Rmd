# Introduction

The main objective of the gene expression methods is to be able to simulate the amount of genes expressed in a pathway during certain situations. For the most part, functions are divided into two types of functions with a certain specification in the function name: "group" specifies the function taking the averages of the genes expressed in the cells, and "sing" specifying the function takes the average gene expressed for each cell at the time. All these calculations are based off the model created using *runCancerSim*


# Main Functions

Within this part of the package, two main functions can be used in order to develop the general gene distributions based on the information wanted.
