##Introduction

Off-Lattice Cell-Based Monte Carlo (OCMC) is a simulation based off previous data that enables the modeling of cell growth. The OCMC package is implemented in C++, and compiled and integrated into R using the Rcpp package. 

##Getting Started

```{r}
# Runs the Model
runModel <- function(initialNum, runTime, density = 0.05,
                    meanGrowth = 0.15, varGrowth = 0.0, maxMigration = 0.5,
                    maxDeform = 0.075, maxRotate = 0.3, epsilon = 0.05,
                    delta = 5.0, outIncrement = 10, randSeed = 0)
runModel(10,10)
```
